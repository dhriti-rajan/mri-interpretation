# MRI Interpretation

## Overview
- Many available MRI datasets contrasting brain activity between a control group
  and an experimental group when placed in various situations.
- Goal: Train model to categorize the patients in these datasets, then look at
  the resulting weights and visualize the aggregate difference between images
  in the two groups (ex: patients in the experimental group generally had more
  activity in x region of the brain).
